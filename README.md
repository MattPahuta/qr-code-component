## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This straightforward component is the first recommended project from the Getting Started on Frontend Mentor learning path. I love the Frontend Mentor platform and have been enjoying the Building responsive layouts and JavaScript fundamentals paths. Being a completionist at heart, I decided to spend a bit of time working through this entry-level learning path as well. The projects may be quite simple, but I do believe there's value in stepping back every once in a while and revisiting the fundamentals and basic building blocks of a craft. Web development is no different. I enjoyed piecing together this component using a bare minimum of markup and styles and being reminded that trying to be overly clever with solutions can get in the way of creating simple, easy-to-understand code. 


### Continued development

While my current main focus is React and more advanced layout techniques, I'm going to continue to spend time working through this entry-level learning path to brush up on fundamentals. This exercise is also helpful in staying active within the community and providing useful feedback for learners at different stages of development.
